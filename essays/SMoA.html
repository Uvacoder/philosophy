<h1>The Standard Model of Alienation</h1>
<pre>The standard model of the human being today recognizes a person made of many parts and is heuristically bifurcated into body/mind.  </pre>
<ul>The mind is made of three parts: 
  <li>affective - the feeling part </li> 
  <li>cognitive - the thinking part </li>
  <li>conative - the acting part </li> 
</ul>
  
<pre>
The employment system pretends that the cognitive and conative parts can be alienated by contract, 
and the affective part is alienated as an externality of the contract system.

If the affective system tries to start a conative process to care for the body a cognitive process often ignores the feeling. 
Under the employment contact, to care for ones body or family may be bad for the capitalist's bottom line, 
and therefor may lead to termination - and far worse ability to care for the body and family.
The alienation of person to bodily obligations for fear of the capitalist retribution is a crime against humanity on the widest scale,
but certainly not the most severe. 

In this essay "capitalist" is one who supports the ownership of laborers and/or the owning of contracts to labor.
This is not a criticism of private ownership of capital, but of ownership of labor as represented in "stock equity".

The employment contract is a tool.
In many circumstances the employment contract is a formalization which protects the employee.

Capitalism is recent in terms of economics, and the capitalist employment scheme has a lot of merit because it is contract based.
Modern human rights protect labor, and labor comes in shades of disenfranchisement.
The worst cases are in places with weak contract law and little to no employee rights.

The alienation of conation is represented in that the law considers the labor of the employee to be the labor of the grand capitalist 
who appropriates the "output of labor". 
Through the legal fiction of incorporation it is pretended that all of the property, including the labor contracts, are owned buy people
who buy "stock" on secondary markets.

That capitalists speak of a "labor market" shows the commodification of humans quite clearly. 
I have spoken with capitalists who support voluntary slavery, slavery of prisoners, and slavery of war prisoners.

In this system the pretend alienation of human cognition plays the role of justification. 
The employee is supposed to be acting on behalf of the cognitive process of the employer. 
The most prized possession of the capitalist is information, 
and to the greatest extent possible most capitalists prefer that employees have as little information about the enterprise as possible. 

Obviously not every employer is abusive, just like not every slave owner was abusive. 
But, the implicit power disparity of the master servant relationship allows for abuse at the convenience of the capitalist.
While some legal recourse remains available to the wage slave in contemporary law, protection under the law is complicated and biased 
in favor of capital accumulators. 
Unfortunately many the worst off are under-educated about their rights, are over-tired from starting out under-privileged, 
or are suffering from a series of unfortunate events which led them into an abusive employment contract.

The whole person is alienated from their humanity in the abstraction which is the employment contract. 
Employment contracts are an important asset to the firm because they represent the submission of the person to the will of the employer.
Of course, this submission is not absolute since chattel slavery has been outlawed, 
but there is something morally dubious about the ownership and transference of contracts of human submission at any level.

It is not a suitable solution for governments to buy or otherwise come to control private enterprise.
