<title>The Standard Model of Alienation</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>The standard model of the human being today recognizes a person made of many parts and is heuristically bifurcated into body/mind. 
<ul>The mind is made of three parts: 
  <li>affective - the feeling part </li> 
  <li>cognitive - the thinking part </li>
  <li>conative - the acting part </li> 
</ul> </p>
  
<pre>
The employment system pretends that the cognitive and conative parts can be alienated by contract, 
and the affective part is alienated as an externality of the contract. 
  
If the affective system tries to start a conative process to care for the body a cognitive process often ignores the feeling because to care for ones body or family may be bad for the capitalist's bottom line, 
and therefor may lead to termination - and far worse ability to care for the body and family.

The culture of work of the employer/employee contract is modeled after the oppressive master/servant contracts of roman law.

The alienation of person to bodily obligations for the sake of the capitalist retribution is a crime against.

Basic human rights protect labor in theory, but labor comes in shades of disenfranchisement, 
and if this inequity is plotted on a bell curve the middle point seems to represent rather poor conditions.

The alienation of conation is represented in that we consider the labor of the employee to be the labor of the grand capitalist who appropriates the "output of labor". 

That capitalists speak of a "labor market" shows the commodification of humans quite clearly. 

In this system the pretend alienation of human cognition plays the role of justification. 
The employee is supposed to be acting on behalf of the cognitive process of the employer. 
The most prized possession of the capitalist is information, 
and to the greatest extent possible most capitalists prefer that employees have as little information about the enterprise as possible. 

Obviously not every employer is abusive, just like not every slave owner was abusive. 
But, the implicit power disparity of the master servant relationship allows for abuse at the convenience of the capitalist.
While some legal recourse remains available to the wage slave in contemporary law. 
Unfortunately many the worst off are under-educated about their rights, are over-tired from starting out under-privileged, 
or are suffering from a series of unfortunate events which led them into an abusive employment contract.

The whole person is alienated from their humanity in the abstraction which is the employment contract. 
Employment contracts are an important asset to the firm because they represent the submission of the person to the will of the employer.
Of course, this submission is not absolute since chattel slavery has been outlawed, 
but there is something morally dubious about the ownership and transference of contracts of human submission at any level.
